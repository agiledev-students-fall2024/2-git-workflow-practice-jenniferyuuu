### Article
An article about software development/engineering that I found interesting is [Revolutionizing Software Development With Large Language Models](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/20/revolutionizing-software-development-with-large-language-models/). 

### What I find interesting 

The article primarily speaks about the profound impact of large language models and AI on software development, including both the benefits and drawbacks. AI is growing faster than ever throughout people's daily lives, workforce, education, commerce, automotive industry, medicine, and more. Although software engineering seems outstanding due to its high-paying income and innovation that comes from it, there are various challenges, such as the software quality and the error-prone process of coding. Hence, LLM can solve these issues by helping humans improve code with less time and effort. 

I found this connection between LLM/AI and software development interesting because AI is mainly known to harm software engineering jobs and there recently has been a lot of news about how AI will be soon replacing real software developers. However, this article emphasizes on the positive aspects that AI can have on us. It will impact future software by writing faster code, analyzing for errors to avoid any big issues, and testing. Another fascinating aspect of the article is the history of software development because it makes us realize how much software has changed over the last century and how tech is prevelent in today's society. Software development has become one of the cores in making technological advancements.
