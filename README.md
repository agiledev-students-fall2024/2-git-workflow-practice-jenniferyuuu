### Article
An article about software development/engineering that I found interesting is [Revolutionizing Software Development With Large Language Models](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/20/revolutionizing-software-development-with-large-language-models/). 

### What I find interesting 

The article primarily speaks about the profound impact of large language models and AI on software development, including both the benefits and drawbacks. AI is growing faster than ever throughout people's daily lives, workforce, education, commerce, automotive industry, medicine, and more. Although software engineering seems outstanding due to its high-paying income and innovation that comes from it, there are various challenges, such as the software quality and the error-prone process of coding. Hence, LLM can solve these issues by helping humans improve code with less time and effort. 

I found this connection between LLM/AI and software development interesting because AI is mainly known to harm software engineering jobs and there recently has been a lot of news about how AI will be soon replacing real software developers. However, this article emphasizes on the positive aspects that AI can have on us. It will impact future software by writing faster code, analyzing for errors to avoid any big issues, and testing. Another fascinating aspect of the article is the history of software development because it makes us realize how much software has changed over the last century and how tech is prevelent in today's society. Software development has become one of the cores in making technological advancements.

Son Nguyen is right that AI can be incredibly helpful for writing readable code and spotting errors, though I'm not sure that it will revolutionize programming as dramatically as he claims. I've found that when I use AI for coding, I need to write very specific prompts that capture the context I'm working in without needing to copy-paste the entire codebase in. I've also found that the larger the context window becomes, the more errors begin to happen, and have had the best results asking for very small chunks of code to do very specific tasks that I then adapt to my own program, or asking for ideas to fix a buggy piece of code - again in discrete chunks.

I think the main benefit of AI is that it aggregates a lot of information and can provide targeted suggestions to your needs, in a way that was previously only possible by asking a human being with limited time and energy to give you tailored help (or a hostile one, like certain posters to Stack Overflow). For instance, I mainly use it for debugging, the way I would have once shown another person my code and asked them if they could see why it wasn't working. In this way, I think it democratizes coding by making learning less reliant on a mentor, and saving time on learning to do new things.
